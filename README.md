A lightweight React app built to demonstrate basic frontend skills using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

Features:

Login and Signup forms with simple validation

Home page styled with Tailwind CSS

Custom 404 page for unknown routes

Uses React Router for navigation

This project isn't connected to a backendâ€”it's focused on structure, styling, and routing. Just a personal showcase to get more hands-on with React and modern frontend tools.
